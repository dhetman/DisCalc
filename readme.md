# DisCalc

_DisCalc_ is a lightweight discount calculator that allows you to calculate a discount of a given value. It's open source and doesn't contain any ads.

This application has been created using Android Studio. It's available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.dhetman.discountcalculator).

To get started, clone this repository and open it using Android Studio (or Eclipse). Gradle should rebuild itself on first start-up and shouldn't be causing any problems. If it does, follow the error prompts and required dependencies will be installed.

I've chosen MIT licence for this project so feel free to modify and distribute changes as you see fit.
