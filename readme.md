#DisCalc

_DisCalc_ is a lightweight discount calculator that allows you to calculate a discount of a given value. It's open source and doesn't contain any ads.

This application has been created using Android Studio. It will be available on Google Play soon!

To get started, clone this repository to your computer and using Android Studio (or Eclipse) open the cloned folder as a project. Gradle should rebuild itself on first start-up and shouldn't be causing any problems.

I've chosen MIT licence for this project so feel free to modify and distribute changes as you see fit.
